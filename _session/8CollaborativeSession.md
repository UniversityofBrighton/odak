This session will be a fun way to learn and discuss the requirements for data infrastructures for Open Data. This will allow attendees who are already working with data or interested in access to information, or transparency and accountability to understand the role and impact of Open Data. Based on a game developed by experts at ODI, this will be a fun way of capturing interest in open data and discussing their implications for research and everyday work practices.
