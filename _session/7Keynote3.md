abstract: "The pyramid Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom shows that, starting from the base, the incremental elaboration at each level is useful to accumulate the experience that allows decision-making processes in every organization, public or private. 
The decision-risk decreases towards the vertex of the pyramid, but only if the value and the quality of the base (data) is high and if the security is granted: there is a need for a continuous attention to standardization and regulation about this, expecially in Health, Social and Environment sectors. 
In e-gov processes, the Public Administration must be both Producer (for citizens, enterprises, professionals and other PA's) and Consumer (e.g. by interoperability with other PA's or by using Research tools and prototypes) of high quality open data, compliant with privacy and transparency. 
We will show some of the most interesting experiences in PA's, pre and post pandemic, at european, national and regional level, originated by citizen's contests or by decision-maker actions. "
