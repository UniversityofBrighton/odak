abstract: "Open data is data that is  freely available to everyone to use and republish as they wish, without any kind of restrictions, be it  copyright, patents or any other mechanisms of control. It is recently become a very important innovation for the Public Administration and citizens in order to improve the transparency and the awareness of the relationship government-citizens.

The seminar will describe the experiences generated by the EU H2020 Project ROUTE-TO-PA,  multidisciplinary innovation project, that, by combining expertise and research in the fields of e-government, computer science, learning science and economy, is aiming at improving the impact, towards citizens and within society, of ICT-based technology platforms for transparency.

The mail objective of the project was to improve the engagement of citizens by making them able to socially interact over open data, by forming or joining existing online communities that share common interest and discuss common issues of relevance to local policy, service delivery, and regulation; citizens are also empowered to co-create open datasets, thereby becoming authors and actors in the Open Data ecosystem, rather than simple (maybe even advanced) users.

We will illustrate the guidelines of the project, the Social Platform for Open Data (SPOD) created by the project and several examples of real communities that are using the outcomes of the project, even 3 years after the end of the project. In particular we will describe the experience of HETOR (www.hetor.it) where communities are collectively creating knowledge (in the form of open datasets) about the local cultural heritage, collecting materials, oral traditions, and recollections of their local history. Finally we will explore how, by using Linked Open Data, it is possible to simply create a Virtual Exhibition from personalized requirements.

Acknowledgments: Most part of the work was supported by the grant of EU Horizon 2020 project ROUTE-TO-PA. We thank all the researchers of the ROUTE-TO-PA project for very interesting and useful discussions. We also thank all the participants of the project and all the citizens and organizations that collaborated in the use cases."
