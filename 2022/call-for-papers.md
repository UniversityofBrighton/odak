We seek different types of contributions:

### Research Articles
1. Full Papers: innovative research, in any of the topics below (maximum 8 pages, including references), with  explicit reporting of evidence of results. 
2. Case Studies: update of ongoing projects, in any of the topics below (maximum 5 pages, including references), including national or international multidisciplinary projects.
3. Posters: visual communication on topics of interest to be displayed at the event in an open area, together with an associated report (maximum 2 pages, including references) describing the topic, with explicitly stated key points, a textual description introducing the poster and the described project and a textual explanation of graphical diagrams or images reported in the poster. 

Both academia and industry contributions are welcome. 
Contributions should follow the template from the [Electronic Workshops in Computing (eWiC) series](https://www.bcs.org/about-us/learned-publishing/electronic-workshops-in-computing-ewic/).

Reviewers will take into consideration:
- Clarity of presentation
- Relevance and completeness of the literature
- Novelty of the proposal
- Evidence-based contributions 

We encourage the publication of datasets and source code in public repositories, such as GitHub or Zenodo, as a core aspect of the proposed symposium. If data or the source code cannot be shared with the community, authors should explicitly state the reason for this limitation.

These contributions are solicited (but not limited to) in the following topics:
- Secure and privacy of open data and knowledge
- Interoperability and semantic web
- Open Source solutions for creating and accessing data and knowledge
- Large scale digitisation of analogue data, both 2D and 3D
- Technologies for linked data complaint with the FAIR principles  
- Data quality including quality of data content and data format
- Data analytics, including artificial intelligence, of aggregated large-scale datasets
- Visualisation (inc. immersive environments) of large-scale datasets
- Human-computer interaction with open data and knowledge
- Business aspects and sustainability of open data
- Applications of open data and knowledge in Health, Public Sector, Education and Cultural Heritage
- Open Science best practices and Reproducibility of research with open datasets


These contributions will be published in the [Electronic Workshops in Computing (eWiC) series](https://www.bcs.org/about-us/learned-publishing/electronic-workshops-in-computing-ewic/).

### Panel Sessions 
We welcome expressions of interest to organise or contribute a talk to panel sessions exploring cross-cutting areas of interest, including but not limited to the following: 

1. Towards the interoperability, including challenges, technologies and future directions
2. Security and privacy, including software system engineering considerations, as well as IPR and legal aspects 
3. Quality validation, including priorities such as quantity vs quality.
4. Business models for tackling open data, including success stories, insights and best practises
5. Ethics of open sharing, including licensing and other considerations.
6. Any other cross-cutting topic

If you are interested in contributing to these panels, please send a short abstract (max 500 words) with the topic contribution and speakers. We plan to produce a summary of these panel sessions to accompany a publication for wider dissemination of these topics.

### Software Projects
We welcome talks about relevant software projects detailing how the software addresses a problem in an novel and effective manner. In particular, we are interested in insights and new modalities for co-development, as well as sharing knowledge and expertise across teams of developers distributed across the world.
