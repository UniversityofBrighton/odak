This international symposium, supported by the [University of Brighton](https://www.brighton.ac.uk/csius), aims to bridge the gap between researchers, service providers and end users creating, aggregating and providing access to open data and knowledge to address the global challenges exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. These challenges are related to health, societal inclusion, economic loss as well as the lack of access to education and learning opportunities. Such challenges would entail standard and consolidated process requiring reflection and reworking to be adapted to new settings. For example, whilst two years ago data providers were encouraged to publish data openly, due to the pandemic digitization has become mandatory in order to easily share and disseminate information with end-users.  In this environment, organisations across the world require secure, interoperable and intelligent software systems to support digitisation, linking, aggregating, analysing, visualising and providing access to data and knowledge by using technologies such as semantic web, artificial intelligence, data analytics, immersive visualisation, as well as human-computer interaction. 

The symposium will allow participants to discuss about the latest research, case studies, and best practises across various disciplines and sectors such as Health, Finance, Public Sector, Education, Media and Culture. Cross-cutting issues will also be explored including interoperability, business models, security and privacy, as well as ethics, and legal aspects of open data. 

For the research community and practitioners, the symposium will provide an excellent scientific forum to exchange novel ideas and look ahead to potential directions for the development/deployment of software systems for sustainable development in a post-pandemic era. For end users, the event will provide a unique opportunity to feed into technical developments as well as to identify new techniques and ideas which can be transferred into practice.

If you would like to engage in the (live) discussion you will need to register at <a href="https://forms.gle/Cg6Asr7Dwi4JvJAY8">https://forms.gle/Cg6Asr7Dwi4JvJAY8</a> so you can join us on Rocket.Chat (RC) at <a href="https://rc.egsr2020.london">rc.egsr2020.london</a>. RC is used for ours #announcement, #general discussion and specific exchange about an individual #paper_X. RC also enables you to ask questions to presenters. These will be posted on the channel of the respective paper and read by the session chair.<br><br>

If you have previously been active at EGSR, we will have registered you already and send you an email with credentials. In this case, you do not need to register again.</p>	</div>

<!--<p><i>Due to the developing COVID-19 situation, we have pushed back the research papers abstract deadline to Monday April 13 and the paper submission deadline to April 17.<br>
Furthermore, this yearâ€™s EGSR will take place completely virtually. We are currently evaluating available options for remote attendance and the format and details for this are still being worked out. Authors of accepted papers this year will be asked to present their work remotely. We encourage authors to submit work to EGSR despite the altered circumstances of a virtual EGSR meeting.</i></p>
Please see the <a href="/faq">EGSR 2020 FAQ</a> for more information about COVID-19 and changes to the conference this year.

## Eurographics Symposium on Rendering
 The 31st edition of Eurographics Symposium on Rendering was held virtually from June 30th to July 3rd, 2020. EGSR 2020 is being jointly organized by the <a href='https://wp.doc.ic.ac.uk/rgi/'>Realistic Graphics and Imaging group</a> at Imperial College and the <a href='http://vecg.cs.ucl.ac.uk/'>Virtual Environments and Computer Graphics group</a> at University College London (UCL). EGSR was preceded by the 8th annual Workshop on Material Appearance Modeling (MAM) on June 29th, which was also held virtually.
