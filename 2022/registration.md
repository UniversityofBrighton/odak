More information will be provided soon regarding registration fees, which we aim to keep as low as possible. The following table illustrate our registration options:

<table >
  <tr style="border: 1px solid black;">
    <td width="20%"><b>Day 1 delegate fee</b></td>
    <td width="60%">Include access to day 1 sessions></td>
    <td width="20%">TBC</td>
 </tr>
  <tr style="border: 1px solid black;">
    <td><b>Day 2 delegate fee</b></td>
    <td>Include access to day 2 sessions</td>
    <td>TBC</td>
  </tr>
  <tr style="border: 1px solid black;">
    <td><b>All-inclusive delegate fee</b></td>
    <td>Include access to all event, including evening events</td>
    <td>TBC (we expect this fee to be no higher that Â£150)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr style="border: 1px solid black;">
    <td><b>Student delegate fee</b></td>
    <td>Include access to all event, including evening events for those with a valid student card</td>
